👋 Hi, I’m @prmcmanus


I've built: 
- Android images

After "Stagefright" was patched, I continued to build images for older devices that couldn't upgrade to the latest version of Android.

- Patched Linux kernels

For my device at home

- custom Linux Distributions for diagnostic repair.

For work, used for thousands of repairs to enable diagnostics that didn't rely on viewing or unencrypting customer data.


I'm here to learn more and contribute towards projects where possible.
