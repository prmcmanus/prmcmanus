👋 Hi, I’m @prmcmanus

My profile photo was made to enrage my daughter. It worked a charm 😂

I've built: 
- Android images. After "Stagefright" was patched, I continued to build images for older devices that couldn't upgrade to the latest version of Android.  
I've also merged projects to make my own release.
- Linux Distributions for diagnostic repair. For work, used for thousands of repairs to enable diagnostics that didn't rely on viewing or unencrypting customer data.  
Customised for that employer, using their branding

👀 I’m interested in ... Motorbikes, Linux and FOSS

🌱 I’m currently learning ... LFS211 and working towards LFCE
